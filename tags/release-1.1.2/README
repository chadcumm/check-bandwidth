   ~ Nagios(r) SNMP Network Traffic Monitor Plugin

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction

  Based on check_traffic and check_snmp_cisco_ifstatus plugins (as both had
  features that I needed, but neither were quite right), check_bandwidth is a
  re-write from the ground up using perl's Net::SNMP library.

  Simply specify the hostname and interface number (plus community, if not 
  'public') and it will make a request against the device for the interface's 
  statistics.

  It's then compared against the cache of the last request and bandwidth is 
  calculated. If no cache exists (or --on-the-fly specified, preventing use of 
  the cache), then the program will sleep for a short period of time
  (controlled with --pause) before re-fetching the statistics and calculating
  the bandwidth.

  The program can output in either bits (by default) or bytes (using
  --use-bytes) and will convert all values into human-readable format by
  default (i.e. Kb, Mb, Gb...), unless forced to use Mb for all output with 
  --use-mega.

  Finally, warning & critical status reports can be set independently for each 
  direction, as well as calculated as a percentage of available bandwidth or 
  absolute (by specifying a suffix, such as 10M for 10 megabit, or 10 megabyte 
  if --use-bytes specified).

  Note: Nagios is a registered trademark of Ethan Galstad. 


2. Requirements

  To use this plugin you should have installed:
    1. Nagios(r) (http://www.nagios.org)
       This plugin was successfully tested with v2.8, and although should work
       with other versions, is untested on all others (feedback welcomed).

    2. Perl & Net::SNMP Module
       Was tested with Perl 5.8.8 and Net::SNMP 5.2.0 as well as Perl 5.8.5 and
       Net::SNMP 5.1.2 (again, feedback welcomed).

    3. Read-only access to SNMP on the device(s) you want to question

  Plugin has been successfully tested on Gentoo Linux and CentOS4 servers, and
  should work on all distributions provided the above three criteria match.


3. Quick install

  Please follow these steps to install check_bandwidth (it's pretty easy
  really - unpack, move and configure!)

    1. Unpack package into a temporary directory. (eg: /usr/tmp) and copy
       the check_bandwidth script into your plugins directory
         (e.g. /usr/nagios/libexec)

    2. By default, check_bandwidth will store all cache files under the
       directory /tmp/.traffic. If you want to change this, please edit the
       file and change the $_storage variable towards the top.

    3. Make sure check_bandwidth can create and/or write to the $_storage
       directory.

    4. Configure Nagios(r) to use the plugin with the command-line attributes
       that you require (see './check_bandwidth --help') for full details on
       all available options.

    5. Reload Nagios daemon.

4. Known Bugs & TODOs

    - Performing more analysis on the returned data from the device to work out
      if it's going to be worth caching, rather than attempting to cache and
      then process later (possible issue with devices not returning correct
      interface speed value).

4. Notes

  The plugin works well for me and is in use on my system and should work fine.

  I am always open to feedback, bug reports, etc. from users (may of which have
  been incorporated into the program over various revisions - your comments do
  matter).

  Please feel free to drop me an e-mail on jonathan (at) jabwebsolutions.co.uk.

5. Changelog

  1.0.0 (23.04.2007)
   - Initial Release

  1.0.1 (19.05.2007)
   - Corrected error in checking of cached data where a variable was used that
     had not yet been created (referenced $recount not $count).
   - Made changes to --help message

  1.0.2 (14.11.2007)
   - Corrected reported error with $ext not being defined before it was used

  1.0.3 (19.12.2007)
   - Corrected another error in checking of cached data where ifSpeed could be
     0 and the program would still attempt division by it, terminating the
     program.

  1.0.4 (26.01.2008)
   - Removed check against ifNumber of interfaces as shows number of entries
     and interfaces may not be numbered in order.

  1.1.0 (27.01.2008)
   - Altered code for locating storage to support Win32 platforms as well (will
     now use either '/tmp/.traffic' or 'c:\Windows\Temp\traffic' by default).
   - Added --save to allow you to define your own location to store the default
     storage location (still uses currently location logic, with sub-directories
     based on hostnames).
   - Changed text for --warning to more specifically explain the logic behind
     the %age/relative logic for --warning and --critical.
   - Also added support for straight bits/bytes with 'B' option to --warning and
     --critical logic.
   - Rewrote Performance Data return to be PnP compatible, with separate
     entries for both in and out streams.
   - Corrected error in short usage description (specified --bytes when it's 
     actually --use-bytes).
   - Added support for changing the SNMP agent port
   - Removed support for --check-up in this version as it currently doesn't work
     (is available, and should work, in the 2.x series)
   - Improved checking for the --interface option

  1.1.1 (28.01.2008)
   - Corrected error introduced by the fix in 1.0.2, where $ext wasn't defined
     originally, so was set to 'b' as a default. However, this outputed 'bbps'
     instead of 'bps', so it's now been changed to a blank value and should work
     as intended now!
    
  1.1.2 (26.03.2008)
    - Fixed bug in PnP settings where the values were the wrong way round.
